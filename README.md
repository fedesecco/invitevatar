# Invitevatar

Invitevatar builds **digital event inviters**—each one a friendly AI-driven “invitavatar” that lives behind a shareable link. When recipients open that link they meet your avatar, hear the event pitch, and can continue the conversation through follow-up questions or a live chat powered by AI.

## What it does

- Hosts a customizable landing page per event where a 3D-style avatar introduces the event and provides key details.
- Lets attendees ask follow-up questions or request clarification, with the avatar responding in real time using AI dialog.
- Logs interactions so organizers can see what people asked, highlight FAQs, and keep engagements human yet scalable.

## Next steps

1. Hook up your preferred AI/chat backend to drive avatar responses.
2. Add a content management flow so event hosts can edit the avatar script without redeploying.
3. Deploy the built bundle to a hosting provider and share the unique inviter link.
